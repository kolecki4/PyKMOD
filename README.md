# PyKMOD
A Kurucz model atmosphere interpolator for Python!

This is essentially a re-writing of the original tool, [KMOD](http://hebe.as.utexas.edu/stools/), which was written in IDL.
Python being a more flexible language, PyKMOD can be run either by importing it into a Python script and using the function pykmod(), or it can be run directly from the command line via your Python interpreter.

(Should be run with the latest versions of SciPy and Numpy)
